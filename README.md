# BP3 Angular Frontend
Thank you for participating in the BP3 Coding Exercise. This is a small Angular project that captures the essence of
the type of work that we do here at BP3.

## General Information
In this directory you will find three modules `ui`, `api` and `db` containing some json data.  

### Json Database
The json data in the `db` module will act as our database.  Inside the data.json file you will find a list of objects.  These objects represent tasks.  

### API
`api` has been built using an express server with several basic routes to interact with the json database so that you can focus on the front end work.
You may need to implement other basic methods or modify existing ones to accomplish your goals. 
Info on how to start the api server is in the api > README.md file.

### UI
The `ui` module is where you will build out the front end for the custom task list
Info on how to start the ui server is in the ui > README.md file.

##Exercise Instructions
The exercise instructions are in the `BP3 Frontend Coding Challenge.pdf` file in this directory.
